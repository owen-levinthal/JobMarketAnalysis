Hello! This is my analysis of the "Data Analyst" job market. I wrote two Python data collection scripts in Jupyter Notebook to collect job posting data from [Indeed.com], and job data from HB1 Visa filings available at [h1bdata.info]. The resulting data was imported to Microsoft PowerBI where it was cleaned and interactively visualized.

This project is split into two parts: data collection and data analysis. The best way to view the data collection scripts (.ipynb files located in the data collection folder) is with Jupyter notebook, but I've added .py exports for viewing in your preferred IDE. The analysis is best viewed in PowerBI using the .pbix file, but I've also included a .pdf export of the report.
