About Harvest
Harvest is an industry-leading, independent software company that makes tools to help businesses run more smoothly. We believe that businesses only succeed by using their time intentionally. Our products support our customers through time tracking, reporting, and forecasting features.
Harvest started in 2006 as a team of three and has grown to today’s current team of almost 90 with Harvesters working from around the globe. We’ve worked as a remote team since the beginning and we continue to hire the right people for the job no matter where they call home.
We strive to create a workplace culture where everyone feels valued, included, and heard. One important aspect of this is continuing to create spaces for diverse life experiences and work histories. If you are a member of a group that is historically underrepresented and disadvantaged in tech, business, and society in general, we want to meet you and we encourage you to apply.
Why We’re Hiring
We are looking for a Data Analyst to uplevel Harvest’s business and product insights, developing reporting and data visualizations that inform strategic decisions throughout the entire Harvest organization.
In this role, you will leverage your technical skills to synthesize and analyze data, then present your findings via clear and consumable reporting that ensures understanding and elevates data literacy.
To be successful in this role, you must be an exceptional communicator, capable of translating complex ideas into actionable insights and presenting to all levels of the organization. You must have strong technical abilities, with expertise in SQL, Python and R combined with strong analytical skills.


What You’ll Do:
Collaborate with internal stakeholders to establish KPIs and develop clear, consumable reporting. Help partners flesh out their questions, diving deeper and presenting your findings to them at the appropriate level of granularity and detail.
Synthesize data from a variety of sources to develop and present reporting and data visualizations that drive understanding and inform action for Harvesters at every level of the organization.
Leverage your extensive SQL knowledge to query and analyze data; when more advanced analysis is required, use Python or R to explore, visualize and analyze data while codifying business logic using DBT (Data Build Tool) and automating reports using Mode, our BI tool of choice.
Cultivate a nuanced understanding of Harvest’s data and lead research to uncover the questions we don’t know we should be asking, both for our business and product.
Improve our data systems by collaborating with colleagues across Harvest to continue to expand and centralize our knowledge into DBT while ensuring stakeholders understand how to access this knowledge.
Requirements
Appetite and effort to stay up to date on the latest trends
Strong attention to detail with an analytical mind to problem-solve
Excellent written and verbal communication skills
Proven ability to visualize data in a way that increases understanding
Ability to work independently with minimal supervision while delivering results
Fluency in SQL and an added benefit if comfortable with a scripting language (preference for Python/R)
Benefits
At Harvest, our compensation consists of three main components:
A competitive base pay: The salary for this role is $165,000 in USD. Every Harvester with the same role expectations receives the same base pay. And we aim to pay at the top of the market (informed by third-party data) for all roles.
Individual and company performance bonus plans: We believe in rewarding performance, so all Harvesters are eligible to receive an individual and company performance bonus after working with Harvest for a period of time.
Competitive benefits*: We offer a number of benefits, including
15 days of vacation in your first year, plus company holidays and a week off for winter break. And you’ll get an additional two days per year until you reach twenty days.
100% coverage of health insurance premiums across our medical, dental, and vision plan offerings for you, your spouse, and your dependents
A yearly budget for your professional learning and development goals
401k plan with a 6% company match after three months with the company
16 weeks of paid family leave to all new parents with the option to use it all at once or throughout the baby’s first year as well as a virtual platform providing support across fertility, pregnancy, adoption, and through your first year of parenting
A charitable giving matching program to support your contributions to your favorite charitable organizations
And much more...

About Crumbl Cookies
Crumbl began as a small cookie shop in the small town of Logan, Utah. It started with one big dream, two crazy cousins, and the perfect combination of flour, sugar, and chocolate chips. Crumbl was established in 2017 in Logan, Utah by Jason McGowan and Sawyer Hemsley. After thousands of dollars in wasted dough, recipes that did not live up to their expectations, and cookies that were just plain embarrassing to them today, Crumbl has over 600 locations across the United States and is growing everyday!

dv01's data analytics platform brings unparalleled transparency into investment performance and risk for lenders and Wall Street investors in structured products. As a data-first company, we wrangle critical loan data and build modern analytical tools that enable strategic decision-making for responsible lending. In a nutshell, we're helping prevent a repeat of the 2008 global financial crisis by offering the data and tools required to make smarter data-driven decisions resulting in a safer world for all of us.
More than 400 of the largest financial institutions use dv01 for our coverage of over 75 million loans spanning mortgages, personal loans, auto, buy-now-pay-later programs, small business, and student loans. dv01 continues to expand coverage of new markets, adding loans monthly, and developing new technologies for the structured products universe.
To get a better idea of what a year at dv01 looks like, check out our 2022 Year in Review page here: https://dv01.co/year-in-review/2022/ If that looks like fun to you, get in touch because we'd love to hear from you.
You Will:
Be on the cutting edge of structured finance and technology. You will be a critical piece in dv01's robust expansion into the capital markets and structured finance space, combining your knowledge with our state-of-the-art technologies.

You want to work with a team of awesome project managers, business analysts, developers, and data analysts to migrate clients to our TaxSys software. At Grant Street, you will have the opportunity to be part of a project team of 2-3 developers and 2-3 data analysts (including yourself).

You love analyzing data and solving puzzles. In this position, you will help reverse-engineer legacy tax data and write specs for conversion into TaxSys.

You’re an excellent communicator. Communication, both written and verbal, is what you do. You’ll work on specs for developers, documentation status updates for management, and customer communications. You know your audience, and you adapt to their needs and technical level. You keep it brief and to the point.
You love working with people. As a data conversion analyst, you’ll be the face of Grant Street Group. You’ll guide clients as they verify their data in TaxSys. You’ll help them understand tradeoffs and make decisions – for example, between “more” and “cleaner” data. Clients consistently describe our conversions as the best vendor experience they’ve ever had, and you will be one of the key people making that happen.
Qualifications:
At least 1 year of experience in each of the following:
Working directly with customers
Experience with data mapping, specifications, and/or other deliverables for developers
Analyzing data using SQL tools
Experience with SQL

Additionally, the Data Hacker / Analyst can choose to engage as actively as desired on the development and evolution of modern software solutions that our team and potentially even residents will use to improve their Glencrest experiences.
While much of the work can be done remotely, commuting proximity to our downtown San Francisco office (ideally spending 2 - 3 days a week in the office) is required.
Detailed description of responsibilities
The Data Hacker / Analyst will be the go-to resource at Glencrest for creating standard reports, models, one-off analyses and accessing third party data to help each of our core functions operate efficiently. Additionally, we have begun creating custom software solutions (using third-party developers) to support our internal workflow and expect to do a lot more of this. The Data Hacker / Analyst may choose to play a key role in guiding the development of future software development projects (not required).
Over time, we expect the needs of this function to grow beyond the capacity of a single person so we will look to build the team with internal and external (contractor / vendor) resources.
The position will support each of the following functions (sample projects included):
Asset management
Standard reporting - we have a host of reports that support internal and external decision-making and commitments, e.g., weekly marketing, staff and operations reports, quarterly lender reports, etc. We’d like to automate the creation and distribution of these processes to the extent possible. Additionally, we’d like to enhance the way we track capital expenditures at the property level and across the portfolio; this is an area that offers significant opportunity for creativity with tangible benefits to our business.
Management reporting - we review our portfolio on a quarterly basis and have a first-version package of reports that we use to support this process. We’d like to evolve our reporting package to simplify the process each quarter and augment what’s shared with the team. Over time, we’d like to create dashboards for internal and external data sharing, e.g., for property financial performance and water / energy consumption.
Resident experience - help develop or license passive data collection and surveys to gather resident experience data. Create benchmarks, reports and dashboards to help our team drive improved outcomes.
Property marketing - help improve our ability to collect and analyze data to support optimization of marketing spend per signed lease.
Benchmarking - as our portfolio grows, we have the ability to identify operational trends to support annual budgeting and ongoing asset management.
Acquisitions
Underwriting - we currently use a second-generation underwriting model. This needs to be iteratively improved to ensure flexibility while reducing the risk of mistakes.
Benchmarking - we would like to incorporate internally-generated and externally-accessed operational, transactional and demographic data for target properties. Ideally these data would be accessible from within the underwriting model over time.
Team effectiveness - build and / or test and, ultimately, license and integrate software solutions that support the acquisitions process.
Investor relations
Semi-annual reports - we offer standardized reports to our investors in July and January to keep them informed of the performance of their investments. This process is semi-automated now but can benefit from further refinement over time.
Custom reports - our goal is to provide a top-decile investor experience. To that end, we’d like to offer investors useful ways to view investment performance, e.g., through customized portfolio returns.
Data feeds - we’d like to automate data feeds into investment management platforms used by investment advisors whose clients invest with us.
Admin
Employee reporting - we aspire to be a top employer in the real estate investment industry. To do so, we need to measure our progress in key areas such as employee engagement and sentiment on an ongoing basis.
Expense reimbursement workflow - our team’s expense reimbursement requirements are not simple as we bill certain expenses back to properties we own, e.g., those related to our due diligence or asset management processes. Currently this process is somewhat manual and could be improved.

Our ~15 person company designs complex web and mobile apps for our clients who represent a variety of industries and company sizes, and all of our employees are remotely located. Hours for this job are fairly flexible, but it is important to keep those hours consistent from week to week and to have a quiet environment from which you can lead conference calls with clients.
We are looking for a client-facing Business Analyst/UX enthusiast.
Our digital agency builds custom apps and complex websites for our clients. Whether we are making simple tweaks to an existing website, overhauling a project-gone-awry that we inherited from another development company, or building something glorious from the ground up, our Business Analysts lead the charge.
This is a role of many hats with much autonomy. Our ideal candidate is very comfortable interviewing clients (on Zoom) to determine the requirements for a project and keeping clients aware of project status and roadblocks. We take usability seriously and you should come to us with a passion for wireframing amazing experiences. This role is also responsible for documenting detailed software specs. A background with use cases or user stories would be helpful. This person should also be comfortable interacting with developers, graphic designers or other BA’s who may be located offshore (often in the Philippines). All BAs also serve as a QA analyst on their own projects, offering backup to a dedicated QA analyst. We love to work with people who are empathetic to users, responsible, organized, and aggressive about tackling challenges.

We have team members in the Philippines and Latin America who drive development, graphic design, marketing, and some of our requirements.
Your Personality
You are a natural communicator who is equally comfortable on Zoom with clients (asking requirements questions), IMing domestic and offshore developers (when they need help with ambiguous requirements or need to be kept on track with schedule), or writing gloriously clear requirements for developers.
You are passionate about user experience and will naturally serve as an internal advocate of our clients and their users.
You can advise clients, team members and developers in a respectful and considerate manner.
You have enough self-discipline to work remotely while maintaining a structured work day that everyone can count on.

Our ~15 person company designs complex web and mobile apps for our clients who represent a variety of industries and company sizes, and all of our employees are remotely located. Hours for this job are fairly flexible, but it is important to keep those hours consistent from week to week and to have a quiet environment from which you can lead conference calls with clients.
We are looking for a client-facing Business Analyst/UX enthusiast.
Our digital agency builds custom apps and complex websites for our clients. Whether we are making simple tweaks to an existing website, overhauling a project-gone-awry that we inherited from another development company, or building something glorious from the ground up, our Business Analysts lead the charge.
This is a role of many hats with much autonomy. Our ideal candidate is very comfortable interviewing clients (on Zoom) to determine the requirements for a project and keeping clients aware of project status and roadblocks. We take usability seriously and you should come to us with a passion for wireframing amazing experiences. This role is also responsible for documenting detailed software specs. A background with use cases or user stories would be helpful. This person should also be comfortable interacting with developers, graphic designers or other BA’s who may be located offshore (often in the Philippines). All BAs also serve as a QA analyst on their own projects, offering backup to a dedicated QA analyst. We love to work with people who are empathetic to users, responsible, organized, and aggressive about tackling challenges.
Hours may grow to full-time but we are initially expecting 20-25 hours per week for this role. You can choose your own schedule within business hours M-F of any US time zone. 100% remote. You must be a US citizen.
Our team is roughly 20 people at the moment. We all work remotely and collaborate using tools like Slack, Teamwork, and Jira. Our US-based team handles things such as sales, project management, and requirements. We have team members in the Philippines and Latin America who drive development, graphic design, marketing, and some of our requirements.
Your Personality
You are a natural communicator who is equally comfortable on Zoom with clients (asking requirements questions), IMing domestic and offshore developers (when they need help with ambiguous requirements or need to be kept on track with schedule), or writing gloriously clear requirements for developers.
You are passionate about user experience and will naturally serve as an internal advocate of our clients and their users.
You can advise clients, team members and developers in a respectful and considerate manner.
You have enough self-discipline to work remotely while maintaining a structured work day that everyone can count on.
You are entrepreneurial and naturally fill gaps that you’ve identified.
You are bold enough to grab ownership of tasks without being asked.

In a perfect world, every lease would end with zero balance. Properties and tenants could go their separate ways without squabbling over outstanding debts and deposits.

At LeaseLock, we believe in a better way. We’re empowering the built world with better technology and equipping property owners and operators with a new generation of financial tools to reduce risk, recapture revenue, and optimize asset performance. Our financial technology creates more valuable, efficient properties by turning unpredictable loss and damage into dependable operating income, getting each lease closer to zero balance.
Powered by our data platform and AI risk engine, LeaseLock develops solutions, like our flagship lease insurance, that are driving the future of residential rental real estate. Launched in 2016 and growing rapidly, we’ve insured over $6 billion in leases with clients representing the top property management companies and ownership groups in the country.

1 in 5 students has a learning disability such as dyslexia, which makes it harder for them to read, spell and write-despite their intelligence. While receiving a proper evaluation for a learning disability could be the most impactful event in a student's life, only 4% of students receive a diagnosis because of the high costs of evaluations and lack of access to qualified psychologists. Undiagnosed students are 3x more likely to drop out of high school, 5x more likely to be unemployed, and tend to experience elevated levels of anxiety and depression. It's estimated that early diagnosis of dyslexia and other learning disabilities could save the US over 72 billion dollars of economic impact and drastically improve the lives of millions of people.
Marker Learning is on a mission to make learning disability (e.g. dyslexia) assessments and diagnosis easier and more affordable for schools and parents. By leveraging proprietary technology developed by leading experts at Johns Hopkins, the end-to-end evaluation is completed in half the time and at 1/10th the cost of typical in person evaluations.

Proactive: Eager to grow and develop skills, welcomes both positive and constructive feedback then adjusts accordingly
Experience with data analytics tools and platforms (we use SQL, Python, Mode, BigQuery)
BS or MS in Statistics, Computer Science (or equivalent field) or relevant technical experience
